Vehicle Authentication Secure Transition

VAST (Vehicle Authentication Secure Transition) is an digital storage based application ,where you are given with a special code(QR code but can be changed in coming future) ,which when scanned (by the inspector) jumps to profile page of the person and provides the Vehicle details , License , RC, insurance , basically every detail and virtual copy of driving essentials. All of this in just a single scan, and the concept here is to make a card as replacement of all those previously mentioned essential documentations. A card or printable code on the Vehicle number plate.The plus point here is that we have both the written info as well as virtually stored documentation.

I have used firebase and Android studio for the project you can find the debug apk attached in this thread.
